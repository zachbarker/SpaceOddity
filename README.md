### How do I contribute? ###
1. git checkout front_end OR git checkout back_end
2. create your own branches from under these (i.e. norman branch under front_end)
    - work in your own branch.
    - make small commits
3. when done, merge to front_end/back_end via a pull request or do the merge yourself (preferably)
4. eventually, merge from front_end/back_end to development branch when linking disparate components
    - i.e. sending data from the front_end to the back_end etc
5. above all have fun

godspeed.
